# SiameseFC-pytorch

pytorch version of the SiameseFC tracker descirbed in the paper "Fully-Convolutional Siamese nets for object tracking".

This repository includes training and tracking codes.

Note that
(1) The tracking results using the official model (2016-08-17.net.mat) are 2% worse than the original matlab code (https://github.com/bertinetto/siamese-fc).

(2) The training codes exist bugs that cause poor performance.

We are looking for these bugs, and hope you can join us! Furthermore, these codes are added comments to easy understanding.

Finally, we thank all the authors in github. If you have any questions/ are interested in object tracking, please feel free to contact me.
